# Intern-Take-Home-Project

A standard practice in the world of programming & developing is being able to debug other peoples’ code without much context as to what it does. We would like you to debug the application and provide the expected output of the code. We have provided the code in multiple languages. Please choose the language you are most comfortable with. If you have another language that you prefer, please let us know. 

Code:
-	Java: https://github.com/MagMutual/Intern-Take-Home-Project/blob/master/InternJavaProj.java 
-	Python: https://github.com/MagMutual/Intern-Take-Home-Project/blob/master/InternPythonProj.py 
-	C#: 
-	JavaScript: 

Assumptions: 
-	The code will have one error that prevents it from running and one other error that will prevent the correct output from being printed

Deliverables: 
* The code changes that you made & the expected output of the code.
*	Answer the following questions:
    *	Why did you choose this project over the others?
    *	What was your approach with debugging the code?
    *	What did you think of the project?
    *	What didn’t you like about the project?
    *	How would you change the project or approach?
    *	Anything else you would like to share?
